# Hi, I'm Vahid Mirjalili ðŸ‘‹

## Senior Applied Scientist | Machine Learning Enthusiast | Author | Instructor

Welcome to my GitHub page! I specialize in **Multimodal Machine Learning**, **Computer Vision**, and **Natural Language Processing**. With over 10 years of experience in the field, I have worked on cutting-edge projects and contributed to the development of various open-source machine learning models.

## ðŸ“š My Books
- **[Python Machine Learning, 3rd Edition](https://www.amazon.com/Python-Machine-Learning-scikit-learn-TensorFlow/dp/1789955750)**  
  A comprehensive guide to mastering Python for machine learning. It covers the fundamentals and advanced topics with practical examples to get you started with real-world ML projects.

- **[Machine Learning with Python and scikit-learn](https://www.amazon.com/Machine-Learning-PyTorch-Scikit-Learn-learning-ebook/dp/B09NW48MR1)**  
  This book focuses on scikit-learn, the powerful Python library for machine learning. It provides hands-on examples to build scalable ML models.

- **Work in Progress:**  
  **Grokking Transformers** (Coming Soon!)  
  I'm currently working on my latest book, which dives deep into Transformer architectures, explaining how they revolutionized NLP and how you can leverage them in your projects.

## ðŸ’» My Courses
